### Known Issues:
* Sky - lines instead of stars, lines in day
* Music? - I haven't spent the time yet to try and fix sound in my VM, so I'm not sure if music is working or not.

### Things I Spent Significant Time On
* Skydome - I spent way too much time trying to create a far too complex sky.
* Stands - I created all elements of the stands by hand. They are very detailed (curved, complex, textured, etc.)
* Performance issues - Now the only thing that saps performance are the trees.
* Rock formations - Created them by hand in blender.
* Converting to and getting things working with the right version of SDL - luckily I did this relatively early on or it really would have been painful.

### Further Improvements
* I plan to fix the skydome. If I can't figure it out on my own I plan on coming to see you before class this week.
* I plan to add 'lasers' to the scene that originate from the spotlights on stage and move throughout the stands.
* If I don't run into more performance issues and if time allows I'd like to add shadows. Since I'll only have from after
class on Friday until Tuesday to implement them I may not get to them. I also have another major project due on Tuesday.
